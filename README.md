# PPT: ANOMALY DETECTION DATASET OF PRINTED PRODUCTS WITH TEMPLATES
<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/PPTdataset/PPT/blob/master/imgs/eva.jpg" width="800"></div>
We share the specific code implementation of the evaluated methods. This repository documents the code for these evaluation methods for the convenience of the community to reproduce. If you want to reproduce our proposed template matching anomaly detection method, please check the contents of the 'Ours' folder.

For some of the latest evaluated methods, we directly use the source code given in the article.
Specifically, we make some minor adjustments and choose the
best hyperparameters to achieve the goal of anomaly detection
in our PPT dataset. The principle is not adding additional
tricks or modifying the network structure if possible.

In code implementation, we make some minor adjustments and choose the best hyperparameters to achieve the goal of anomaly detection in our PPT dataset. The principle is not adding additional tricks or modifying the network structure if possible.
