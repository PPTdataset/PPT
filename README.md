# PPT
We share the specific code implementation of the following method. For some of the latest methods, such as KD, we directly use the source code given in the article. For some of the more classic Baseline methods, such as AutoEncoder, we implemented it ourselves.

In code implementation, we make some minor adjustments and choose the best hyperparameters to achieve the goal of anomaly detection in our PPT dataset. The principle is not adding additional tricks or modifying the network structure if possible.

The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GKFCRwqyEC8j5c8mjWWjk_Se5c6lUNvn) image and pretrained [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16QjOt0Y1UoD4pYafKfJKM6XH37m9pwLx) can be downloaded by clicking the link.

For the specific operation of the evaluation method code, please refer to the readme in the corresponding folder.
